                            Outside of engineering, I love to be active. On most days that just means going to the gym and lifting weights or going for a run, but when I get
                            a chance, I also like hiking in the PNW.

                <p>
                  For my Senior Capstone Project, I decided to build a solar boat for the Sacremento Municipal Utilites District(SMUD) Solar Regatta. 
                  This competiton consits of three races: a sprint, a slalom, and an endurance race. I worked with a team of four to build a boat that would
                  be able to compete with the other schools. At Cal Maritime, this was a legacy project, so my team was able to work with the seniors before us 
                  to learn more about the competition. Specifically, my team was able to race their boat at the end of our junior year. This gave us a good sense of 
                  how the boat stacked up to the compettion. We were able to pick out a few key flaws that kept the previous seniors in the middle of the pack.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first image above shows the old design for the boat and some of the parts we were interested in. The previous team spent their entire time researching
                  and designing the hulls. This meant they did not have much time to design a good frame or power train. They simply used two by fours to attach the hulls and a 
                  trolling motor. This meant that, although the hulls were very light weight and durable, the boat was slow and not very maneuvarable. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  After racing the boat, we realized that the only thing we wanted to keep were the hulls. This meant that we wanted to keep the catamaran style of boat, while reducing weight and increasing 
                  speed and maneuvarability. My team then broke up the work so that each team member could focus on one main task while helping the others with their tasks. My job was to design the power train. 
                  When we went to the competition, we noticed that the fastest boats all used their own power trains instead of simply using trolling motors. This meant that I would need to come up with a way that 
                  would allow the motor and propellor to work at maximum efficiencies. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="SB-column-right">
                <p>
                  To start my part of the project, I needed to research some ways to reduce the rpm of the drive shaft between the motor and the propellor. With some simple research, I knew that the motor
                  would be spinning somewhere between 2500 and 3500 rpm. I also found that most of the propellors we could buy were rated between 500 and 1500 rpm. This let me know that I would be looking for 
                  a reduction of about 3 to 1. With that in mind, I looked into gears, belts and chains as possible ways to reduce the rpm. While looking at these three methods, there were some issues that 
                  belts and chains had that I thought were too great to justify using them. For starters, the propellor would need to be deep enough in the water to enusure it was used effienctly. This meant
                  that the motor would either need to be in the water, or the belt/chain would need to travel through the water. Both of these options would require some sort of housing that would create a significant 
                  amount of drag. Instead, I decided to go with a gear system. This allowed me to place the motor in the boat, and then use bevel gears and spur gears to rotate the propellor. This would also 
                  allow for less material to be in the water. The second image above shows a Solidworks rendering of the design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  After I came up with the inital design, I stil needed to do more work to ensure that the drive train would not fail. This meant that I needed to look into 
                  what materials I could use and when thos materials world fail. I was mostly interested in the material for the gears and drive shafts, because I wanted to keep the drive train as 
                  light as possible. To analyze these, I created a Matlab program to check if the gears and driveshafts would last for an hour of continuous use. This analysis required some 
                  assumptions to be made, so I just made everything worst-case scenario. Using this Matlab program, I found that we could use plastic bevel gears, but we would need steel spur gears
                  and steel drive shafts. The plastic spur gears I tested failed at the teeth, and the drive shafts had too much bending.
